### Summary

I am a Senior Software Developer with 15 years experience, including exposure to C#, AngularJS, and NodeJS.

I am an active contributor to Open Source AngularJS projects, and enjoy solving problems in new and elegant ways with software, from the back-end of system setup and data management to integration and front-end user experience.

<!-- Software and web developer since 1999. Worked in the banking, telecom, and health industries on external-facing web applications, internal web-based tools, backend data processing and ETL, and systems administration.

### Technical

1. C#
1. AngularJS
1. Javascript / NodeJS
1. Ionic / Phonegap / Cordova
1. Git / Subversion
1. MySQL / SQL Server / Postgres
1. Apache / Nginx / IIS / Express

**C#**

  I have experience with multiple C# frameworks, including ASP MVC, NancyFX,and ServiceStack. I have written extensive unit tests with XUnit, and NUnit. For continuous integration I have used Atlassian Stash for source control, TeamCity as a build server, and Octopus Deploy for deployments. I find TFS difficult to configure, manage, and integration, as well as under-represented in the Open Source community.

**AngularJS**

  I have extensive familiarity with writing web applications with AngularJS, hybrid mobile app development using Ionic Framework (based on AngularJS), and Phonegap, and hybrid desktop applications written with AngularJS and node-webkit. 

  I have used Grunt for building AngularJS modules, Karma, Jasmine, and Protractor for testing, and TravisCI as a build and deployment server. I have tried Gulp but at the time found it minimally supported with plugins, and difficult to run tasks synchronously.

**NodeJS**

  I have used NodeJS for web apps, using Express, Mongooose to connect to MongoDB, and Jasmine for unit testing. I have also used Edge.js as a bridge to use libraries developed in .NET in node-webkit desktop applications.


### Other Technical

1. Git / Subversion
1. MySQL / Postgres / SQL Server
1. Apache / Nginx / IIS / Express
1. Perl / Catalyst / DBIC
